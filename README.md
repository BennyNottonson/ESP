# ESP
Minecraft Username Sniper

ESP uses Mojang's API to get data easily.
# Usage
To use ESP, find your time delay from time.is. Then convert the delay to milliseconds (x1000), and input the number into the Time Delay text field. The date field uses a 24-hour clock format and each vaule must be 2 digits (7 would be 07). I recommend starting the program 5-3 minutes before the name you want to snipe becomes avaible (So your ping is more accurate).

Honestly if you use my code for inspiration I am fine with it, if you are going to take it and say its yours I will only be disappointed with you. Anyways the libraries I used were SimpleJSON and Unirest.
