# ESP
Minecraft Username Sniper

ESP uses Mojang's API to get data easily.
# Usage
To use ESP, find your time delay from time.is. Then convert to milliseconds (x1000), and input that number into the Time Delay text field. The date field uses a 24-hour clock format and each vaule must be 2 digits (7 would be 07). I recommend starting the program 5-3 minutes before the name you want to snipe becomes avaible (So your ping is more accurate).
