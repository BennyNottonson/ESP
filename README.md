# ESP
Minecraft Username Sniper

ESP uses Mojang's API to get data easily.
# Usage
To use ESP fill in each field. The date field uses a 24-hour clock format and each vaule must be 2 digits (7 would be 07). I recommend starting the program 5-3 minutes before the name you want to snipe becomes avaible (So your ping is more accurate).
# Requirements
The only requirement is that you have Java installed. You can get java at: https://www.java.com/en/download/win10.jsp
# Want to rip me off?
Honestly if you use my code for inspiration I am fine with it, if you are going to take it and say its yours I will only be disappointed with you. Anyways the libraries I used were SimpleJSON and Unirest.
